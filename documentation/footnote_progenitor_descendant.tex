\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The progenitor/descendant index}\label{footnote:$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$} of a subhalo points to the subhalo in the previous/next snapshot which has the same HBT TrackId. Therefore this index can only be used to move up/down the main progenitor branch for a subhalo, it provides no information about subhalo mergers.
