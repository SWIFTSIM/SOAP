\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$DiscToTotal fractions} are computed as

\begin{equation}
    D/T = 1 - \frac{2 M_{\rm{}corot}}{M_{\rm{}Tot}},
\end{equation}

where $M_{\rm{}corot}$ is the sum of the mass of the counter-rotating particles,
and $M_{\rm{}Tot}$ is the total mass of particles. This can lead to negative values,
e.g. if there are a small number of particles moving quickly in one direction, and
a larger number of particles moving slowly in the opposite direction. In this case
the larger number of particles would be marked as counter-rotating.
