\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$Luminosities are given in the GAMA bands} and are always using the same order 
as in the snapshots: u, g, r, i, z, Y, J, H, K. These are rest-frame dust-free
    AB-luminosities of the star particles. These were computed using the BC03
    (GALAXEV) models convolved with different filter bands and interpolated in
    log-log (f(log(Z), log(age)) = log(flux)) as used in the dust-free modelling
    of Trayford et al. (2015). The luminosities are given in dimensionless
    units. They have been divided by 3631 Jy already, i.e. they can be turned
    into absolute AB-magnitudes (rest-frame absolute maggies) directly by
    applying -2.5 log10(L) without additional corrections.
