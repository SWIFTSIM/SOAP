\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$Dust quantities assume a six element dust model} with one type of graphite 
grains and two types of silicate grains, each of which has two size bins. The dust mass fractions are
then based on the \verb+DustMassFractions+ dataset in the snapshot, assuming the following order of the
six columns:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Large graphite grains
  \item Large silicate grains of type 1
  \item Large silicate grains of type 2
  \item Small graphite grains
  \item Small silicate grains of type 1
  \item Small silicate grains of type 2
\end{enumerate}

The total graphite mass, \verb+DustGraphiteMass+, is then for example calculated by summing the masses 
contained in columns 1 and 3.
