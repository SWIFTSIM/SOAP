\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$Core excised quantities} All core excised quantities are calculated by excluding the inner 
$0.15~R_{500}$ for the halos, and it is only calculated for \texttt{SO/500\_crit}. Any calculation only uses the particles
for which

\begin{equation}
     0.15 R_{500} \leq \mathbf{r} \geq R_{500}
\end{equation}
