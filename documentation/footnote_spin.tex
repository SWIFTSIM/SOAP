\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The spin parameter} is computed following Bullock et al. (2021):

\begin{equation}
    \lambda{} = \frac{|\vec{L}_{\rm{}tot}|}{\sqrt{2}M v_{\rm{}max} R},
\end{equation}

where $\vec{L}_{\rm{}tot}$ is the total angular momentum of all particles within radius $R$, and $M$ their 
total mass. The angular momentum is computed relative to the halo centre and the total centre of mass 
velocity. Since subhalos do not have a natural radius associated with them, we use the radius where the softened
$v_{\rm{}max}$ is reached.
