\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$Diffuse element masses are computed} by computing the corresponding element 
mass and then subtracting from that the mass of this element that is contained in dust. The latter is obtained 
directly from the dust model by multiplying the corresponding dust grain mass with an appropriate dust 
composition fraction which is stored as metadata in the snapshot file.
