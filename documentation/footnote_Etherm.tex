\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The thermal energy}\label{footnote:$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$} of the gas is computed from the density and pressure, 
since the internal energy was not output in the FLAMINGO snapshots. The relevant equation is

\begin{equation}
    u = \frac{P}{(\gamma{}-1)\rho{}},
\end{equation}

with $\gamma{}=5/3$.
