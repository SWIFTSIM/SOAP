\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The oxygen and iron masses}\label{footnote:$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$} are computed from 
\verb+SmoothedElementMassFractions+ and not \verb+ElementMassFractions+, since the latter were not output in 
the FLAMINGO snapshots. Metal mass fractions on the other hand are based on \verb+MetalMassFractions+.
