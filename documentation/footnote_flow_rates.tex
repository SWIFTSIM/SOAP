\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The flow rates} are computed for three spherical
shells: $R$ = $0.1R_{SO}$, $0.3R_{SO}$, and $0.95R_{SO}$. In all cases the width of the
spherical shell is given by $dR = 0.1 R$. To calculate the mass inflow (outflow) rate
we compute the following sum over particles within the spherical shell which satisfy
$v_r < 0$ ($v_r > 0$),

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{dR} \sum_{i} m_i v_{r, i},
\end{equation}

where $m_i$ is the mass of particle $i$, and $v_r$ is the radial component of the 
velocity w.r.t. to the centre of mass velocity. The centre of mass velocity is computed using all particles within $R$, and so will have a different value for
each spherical shell. $v_r$ also includes the Hubble flow relative to the halo centre. For energy flow rates the sum is

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{dR} \sum_{i} m_i v_{r, i} \left(\frac{v_i^2}{2} + u_i\right),
\end{equation}

where $u_i$ is the internal energy per unit mass and $v_i$ is the total 3D velocity 
relative to the center of mass velocity. For momentum flow rates the sum is

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{dR} \sum_{i} m_i \left(v_{r,i}^2 + \frac{c_s^2}{\gamma}\right),
\end{equation}
 
where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $\gamma$ = 5/3 (the second term accounts for pressure). For the gas phases we also calculate "fast outflow" rates. These are calculated by using the equations above, but only for particles that satisfy $v_r > V_{max} / 4$. The flow rates are always positive, so to compute the net rate you must subtract the inflow rate from the outflow rate.
