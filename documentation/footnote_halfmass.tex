\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The half mass radius}\label{footnote:$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$} is determined from linear interpolation of the 
cumulative mass profile obtained after sorting all particles by radius. For the projected halos (PA), SOAP 
uses the 2D radius (distance to the projection axis) instead of the 3D radius.
