\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The concentration}\label{footnote:$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$} is computed using the
method described in Wang et al. (2023), but using a fifth order polynomial fit to
the R1-concentration relation for $1<c<1000$. Therefore we set a floor of 1 and
a ceiling of 1000 for the values calculated by SOAP. This method assumes halos have
an NFW profile, and is only calculated for the
following SO variations: $200_{crit}$, $200_{mean}$, and $BN98$.
Neutrinos are included in the calculation of total concentration.
The first moment of the density distribution, $R1$, can be estimated from
the concentration. From $R1$ the Einasto concentration can be calculated. It
also possible to estimate other properties, such as $V_{max}$, by using the $R1$
value and assuming an NFW profile. The concentration is only calculated for the
following SO definitions: $200_{c}$, $200_{m}$, $BN98$.
