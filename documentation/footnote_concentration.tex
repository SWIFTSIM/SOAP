\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The concentration} is computed using the
method described in Wang et al. (2023), but using a fifth order polynomial fit to
the R1-concentration relation for $1<c<1000$. This method assumes halos have an
NFW profile. Neutrinos are included in the calculation of total concentration. 
The first moment of the density distribution, $R1$, can be estimated from 
the concentration. From $R1$ the Einasto concentration can be calculated. It 
also possible to estimate other properties, such as $V_{max}$, by using the $R1$ 
value and assuming an NFW profile.
