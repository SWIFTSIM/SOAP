\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$When distinguishing between star-forming and non star-forming gas and 
computing the total star formation rate,}\label{footnote:$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$} we have to be careful about the interpretation of the 
\verb+StarFormationRates+ dataset in the snapshots, since negative values in that dataset are used to store 
another quantity, the last scale factor when that particular gas particle was star-forming. Star-forming gas 
is then gas for which \verb+StarFormationRates+ is strictly positive, and the total star formation rate is the 
sum of only the strictly positive values.
