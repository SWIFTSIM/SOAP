\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$The satellite mass fractions} is obtained by summing the masses of all 
particles within the inclusive sphere that are bound to a subhalo that is not the central subhalo, and 
dividing this by $M_{\rm{}SO}$. This uses the same membership information that is also used to decide what 
particles need to be included in the exclusive sphere and projected aperture properties. For MassFractionSatellites
we only consider particles with the same FOF ID as the most bound particle in the central subhalo. For
MassFractionExternal we include all particles with a FOF ID not equal to the most bound particle in the central subhalo.
