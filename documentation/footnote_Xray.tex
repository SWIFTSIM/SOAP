\paragraph{$^{$FOOTNOTE_NUMBER$}$X-ray quantities are} computed directly from the X-ray datasets in the 
snapshot. They are either in the emission rest-frame, or in the observed-frame of a $z=0$ observer, using
the redshift of the snapshot as the emission redshift . The three bands are always given in the same 
order as in the snapshot:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item eRosita low/soft ($0.2-2.3$~keV)
    \item eRosita high/hard ($2.3-8$~keV)
    \item ROSAT ($0.5-2$~keV)
\end{enumerate}
