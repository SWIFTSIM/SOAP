when they are actually used.

For detailed documentation about the usage of this decorator, see

    Decorator for class methods to turn them into lazily evaluated properties.

    Decorating a function with @lazy_property is practically the same as
    decorating it with @property, except that the function is only evaluated
    once, and only when it is actually used.

    Parameters:
     - fn:
       Function to decorate. Should have the call signature
         def function(self)
       with self an object to which @property functions can be
       attached.

    Returns a new @property function that does the lazy evaluation
    of fn.
